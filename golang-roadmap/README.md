# Go Mastery Roadmap: From Basics to Advanced

This document is a complete roadmap for mastering the Go programming language (Golang), designed to guide learners from beginner level to advanced topics. The structure covers core language fundamentals, concurrency, memory management, tooling, and production-grade practices.

---

## 1. Basics of Go

These are the foundational concepts for anyone starting with Go:

- Variables and Constants
- Data Types (int, float, bool, string)
- Operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
- Control Structures (if, for, switch)
- Functions (basic to variadic)
- Error Handling (basic)
- Packages and Imports
- Basic Input/Output
- Comments and Documentation

---

## 2. Core Language Deep Dive

These are the essential Go internals every developer should know:

- Arrays vs Slices (memory layout, append, capacity)
- Strings (immutability, slicing, internal representation)
- Structs and Embedding
- Pointers (value vs reference, pointer to struct)
- Maps (growth behavior, key deletion, nil maps)
- Interfaces (static vs dynamic typing, internal layout)
- Type Assertions and Type Switches
- Type Aliases vs Type Definitions
- `make` vs `new`
- `len` and `cap`
- Constants (typed vs untyped)

---

## 3. Concurrency in Go

Go's concurrency model is powerful and unique. This section explores it deeply:

- Goroutines (lightweight threads)
- Channels (buffered and unbuffered)
- `select` statement
- Goroutine Leaks & Lifecycle
- Worker Pools
- Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup
- Atomic operations
- Race conditions and the Race Detector
- Scheduler (M:N scheduling model)

---

## 4. Error Handling in Go

Writing robust code means handling errors correctly:

- Idiomatic error handling in Go
- Creating custom error types
- Error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf`, `errors.Join`
- Sentinel errors
- `errors.Is` and `errors.As`
- Best practices and anti-patterns

---

## 5. Testing and Tooling

Go provides first-class support for testing and tooling:

- Testing with the `testing` package
- Table-driven tests
- Benchmarks and performance profiling
- Test coverage and tooling (`go test`, `go bench`, `go cover`)
- Mocks and dependency injection
- Linting and formatting (`go vet`, `golint`, `go fmt`)

---

## 6. Generics (Go 1.18+)

Generics enable type-safe and reusable code:

- Type parameters in functions
- Generic data structures (slices, maps, sets)
- Constraints
- Interface contracts for generics
- Common use cases and patterns

---

## 7. Standard Library Mastery

The Go standard library is rich and powerful. Key packages include:

- `net/http` (HTTP clients and servers)
- `context` (cancellation and timeouts)
- `time`, `math`, `sort`
- `io`, `bufio`, `ioutil`
- `encoding/json`, `encoding/csv`
- `os`, `filepath`, `flag`
- Writing custom middlewares

---

## 8. Memory Management & Runtime

Go abstracts memory but gives tools to understand and optimize:

- Stack vs Heap allocation
- Escape analysis
- Garbage Collection (GC phases)
- Finalizers
- Memory alignment and padding
- Tools for profiling and tracing (`pprof`, `trace`)

---

## 9. Advanced Language Patterns

Clean, idiomatic design patterns in Go:

- Option pattern
- Functional options
- Interface-based plugins
- Service and Repository patterns
- Dependency Injection (without frameworks)
- Composition over inheritance

---

## 10. System Programming and Interop

Use Go for low-level or OS-level work:

- cgo and calling C libraries
- Using `syscall`, `os/exec`
- Working with files and streams
- Writing custom CLI tools
- Binary flags and configuration management

---

## 11. Production-Ready Go

Things to build scalable, reliable systems:

- Logging strategies (structured logs)
- Metrics and observability
- Graceful shutdown
- Middleware chains
- Context propagation
- Managing goroutines in production
- Load testing and debugging

---

This roadmap should guide both beginners and experienced developers to master Go thoroughly. For the best learning experience, apply each concept with small real-world code examples and iterate through increasingly complex use cases.
