### 🔹 Step 1: **Pre-Cleaning (Raw Paddy Intake Monitoring)**

**📌 Process Description:**  
Initial stage where raw paddy is cleaned to remove large impurities like straw, dust, and stones.

**📡 Common Sensors:**  
- **Load Cell** – to measure the weight of incoming paddy  
- **Vibration Sensor** – monitors motor health of pre-cleaning machinery  

**🛠️ IIoT Integrations:**  
- Real-time **intake weight logging**  
- Equipment **vibration anomaly detection**  
- Maintenance alerts based on **vibration trends**

**🎯 Benefits:**  
- Track raw paddy intake per shift/day for better inventory and planning  
- Early alerts on pre-cleaner motor faults → reduced downtime  
- Insights into operational consistency across batches

### 🔹 Step 2: **Destoning & Dehusking**

**📌 Process Description:**  
Separation of stones and removal of husk to prepare brown rice.

**📡 Common Sensors:**  
- **Motor Temperature Sensor** – detects overheating  
- **Vibration Sensor** – identifies imbalance or mechanical issues  

**🛠️ IIoT Integrations:**  
- Continuous **motor temperature tracking**  
- **Vibration-based fault prediction**  
- Alert system for **threshold breaches**

**🎯 Benefits:**  
- Prevent unplanned stoppages due to overheating or mechanical issues  
- Improve equipment lifespan through predictive alerts  
- Minimize manual inspection and reduce maintenance frequency

### 🔹 Step 3: **Paddy Dryer (Moisture Control & Batch Monitoring)**  
> ⭐ **Critical Step – Strong interest from industry in analytics & automation**

**📌 Process Description:**  
Paddy is dried to reduce moisture to an ideal level (usually ~14%) before storage or further processing.

**📡 Common Sensors & Parameters:**  
- **Moisture Sensor (Output)** – measures final moisture content  
- **Temperature Sensor (Dryer Chamber)** – tracks internal temperature  
- **Manual/PLC Batch Input** – for batch identity  

**🛠️ IIoT Integrations:**  
- Real-time **moisture and temperature monitoring**  
- **Batch-wise tracking** with operator-set identifiers  
- **Historical data storage** per batch  
- **Analytics dashboard** for:
  - Batch drying time
  - Moisture trend over time
  - Batch success/failure alerts  
- **Notifications** for:
  - Moisture deviation
  - Dryer temperature faults
  - Batch process completion

**🎯 Benefits:**  
- Ensure **uniform drying** to preserve grain quality and reduce breakage  
- Prevent over/under drying → saves weight and fuel  
- Enable **quality traceability** per batch  
- Improve **operator confidence** with digital batch insights  
- Identify best practices across batches through analytics

### 🔹 Step 4: **Milling (Polishing Stage Monitoring)**

**📌 Process Description:**  
Polishing removes the bran layer to convert brown rice into white rice.

**📡 Common Sensors:**  
- **Vibration Sensor** – detects polishing roller imbalance  
- **Current Sensor (Motor Load)** – identifies stress on motor  

**🛠️ IIoT Integrations:**  
- **Roller vibration monitoring** to avoid mechanical failure  
- **Motor load analysis** to optimize operation  
- Trigger alerts for **excessive wear or clogging**

**🎯 Benefits:**  
- Improve polishing consistency and reduce grain breakage  
- Lower maintenance costs with early issue detection  
- Avoid unplanned downtimes due to unnoticed equipment stress
